# Dockerfile

## Write Dockerfile
In this step we shall create Dockerfile. 

Create a Dockerfile with following content in current directory.
```bash
cat > Dockerfile << EOF
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install apache2 -y && apt-get clean
CMD ["apache2ctl", "-DFOREGROUND"]
EOF
```

Verify the file: 
```bash
cat Dockerfile
```

Above Dockerfile content describes a `Ubuntu 18.04` Docker image with Apache web server installed.

- `FROM` indicates the base image for our build
- Each `RUN` line will be executed by Docker during the build
- Our `RUN` commands must be non-interactive. (You can‘t provide input to Docker during the build.)
- In many cases, we will add the `-y` flag to `apt-get`.

## Build it !

We can build a docker image by executing 
```bash
docker build -t webserver .
```

The docker build command builds an image from a Dockerfile and a context. The 
build’s context is the files at a specified location PATH or URL. The PATH is a 
directory on your local filesystem. The URL is a Git repository location.

The Docker daemon runs the instructions in the Dockerfile one-by-one, committing 
the result of each instruction to a new image if necessary, before finally 
outputting the ID of your new image.

View the stored images on your host:
```bash
docker images
```

## Run an image

Now we have an image created from Dockerfile, we'll run it.
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name www webserver
```

Verify the output with curl:
```bash
curl localhost:8080
```

## Build a webapp image

We need to create a `index.html` file in `html` directory with following content.

```html
<pre class="file" data-filename="html/index.html" data-target="prepend">
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Enhance our existing Dockerfile with following content.
```bash
cat > Dockerfile << EOF
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install apache2 -y && apt-get clean
COPY html /var/www/html
CMD ["apache2ctl", "-DFOREGROUND"]
EOF
```

Verify the Dockerfile: 
```bash
cat Dockerfile
```

Verify the html file: 
```bash
cat html/index.html
```

The `COPY` instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them 
to the filesystem of the container at the path <dest>.

## Build and Run it Again 

```bash
docker build -t webserver .
docker run -d -p 8090:80 --name www1 webserver
```

Verify the updated output with curl:
```bash
curl localhost:8090
```

### Try it yourself

Change the following things:
* Web content should contain `Docker is awesome!`
* Dockerfile should have an `ENTRYPOINT` with the default argument `-DFOREGROUND`

### Validate

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 --name my-web my-image

# interactive shell in the container
# verify hostname and envrionment is the id of the conainer
hostname
env
df

#check if apache is running
ps -aufx
```

***Open second terminal***

Verify if you get your HTML text `Docker is awesome!`:

```bash
curl localhost:80
```
