# Layers

## Layers in docker image

Each Docker image references a list of read-only layers that represent filesystem differences. 

Layers are stacked on top of each other to form a base for a container's root 
filesystem. 

Pull `debian` image to your local system.
```bash
docker pull debian
```

```bash
docker history debian
```
shows you list of layers that `debian` image contains.

More Information you can find out with:
```bash
docker inspect debian
```

## Inspect the layers

More Information about an image you can find out with:
```bash
docker inspect debian
```

There you will also see how the image is build and e.g. which command will executed at the container startup.
```bash
docker inspect debian | grep Cmd --after-context=10
```

Or what user
```bash
docker inspect debian | grep User --before-context=5
```

What's about the sha of the image. 
```bash
docker inspect debian | grep Id
```

You can also use these to run the container:
```bash
docker run -it sha256:0af60a5c6dd017d7023f6b6c71f3ffbb9beb2948d842bcb1ba36d597fb96e75a
```
